### Description

This document describes the statistics available in Orion proxy. The metrics are grouped by their functionality, such as listener stats, TLS statistics, HTTP connection stats, TCP proxy stats, cluster stats, health check statistics, and server statistics.

To enable metrics, you have to build Orion with the feature `metrics` enabled. By default, Orion does support OpenTelemetry for metrics, which allows you to export metrics to various backends like Prometheus, StatsD, or any OpenTelemetry collector.

### Basic Configuration

To enable metrics, add the following configuration to your `orion.yaml` file:

```yaml
envoy_bootstrap:
  stats_flush_interval: 10s

  stats_sinks:
    - name: envoy.stat_sinks.metrics_service
      typed_config:
          "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.stat_sinks.open_telemetry.v3.SinkConfig
          grpc_service:
              google_grpc:
                  target_uri: "http://192.168.0.2:4317" # open-telemetry collector address
```

### Prometheus scrape configuration

In addition to OpenTelemetry, Orion supports Prometheus scraping out of the box. To enable it, you must build Orion with the `prometheus` feature.
This means compiling it with `--features metrics,prometheus`.

Next, enable the admin interface in your `orion.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
envoy_bootstrap:
    admin:
      address:
        socketAddress:
          address: "127.0.0.1"
          portValue: 9901
```

This will expose metrics at `http://127.0.0.1:9901/stats/prometheus`.
You can combine both configurations to export metrics to OpenTelemetry and scrape them with Prometheus simultaneously.
